# reliable-tool-agent

A customer-support agent for a fictional home-goods shop, built as a complete system:
tools served over MCP, LangGraph orchestration, guardrails against prompt injection and
out-of-scope requests, human approval before refunds and cancellations, tracing, and an
evaluation that checks the **final state of the database** rather than the wording of
the answer.

> **Status: work in progress.** Built so far: the fictional shop, read-only access, and
> three read-only tools served over MCP. Sections below describe what is built, not what is planned.

*Solid, coloured boxes are built; dashed grey boxes are planned. The customer identity
travels from the authenticated session straight to the tool server, never through the
model. Source: [`docs/architecture.tex`](docs/architecture.tex) (TikZ).*

## The shop

"Brindle Home" is invented on purpose: a well-known sample database could have been
memorised by the model, and the evaluation would then measure recall instead of tool use.

- `src/reliable_tool_agent/world.py` generates the SQLite database deterministically
  (fixed seed, fixed "today" = 2026-10-15 so that the 30-day return window always gives
  the same answer). Money is stored in integer cents.
- `data/policies/` holds the shop policies the agent must follow (returns, refunds,
  cancellations, privacy, scope).
- `src/reliable_tool_agent/db.py` opens the database read-only, with two independent
  locks (`mode=ro` and `PRAGMA query_only`).

## Tools over MCP

The tools live in `tools.py` as plain Python functions with Pydantic outputs, and
`mcp_server.py` exposes them through the Model Context Protocol, so any MCP client can
use them.

- **The customer identity never comes from the model.** The application starts the
  server for one authenticated customer (`--customer-id`); no tool schema contains a
  customer id. Another customer's order gets the same "not found" answer as a missing
  one, so its existence is not revealed.
- **Expected failures reach the model, crashes do not.** "Order not found" is raised as an
  MCP `ToolError`, whose message the model receives so it can recover. Any other exception
  is treated as a crash: the client gets a generic message and the details stay in the
  server log.

| Tool | Arguments | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `get_order` | `order_id` | status, dates, items and amounts (integer cents) |
| `list_my_orders` | `status` (optional, one of 4 values) | the customer's orders, newest first |
| `search_policies` | `query` | up to 3 numbered policy rules, or an empty list |

Arguments are validated by Pydantic before a tool runs: `list_my_orders(status="lost")`
is rejected with the list of allowed values, so the model can correct itself.

`search_policies` is deliberately simple: overlap of crudely stemmed keywords
(returning / returned → return), ties broken in favour of the policy the query names.
It has no notion of synonyms ("send it back" does not find the returns policy; a test
documents this limit). The policies are short enough (~600 tokens) to fit in the prompt;
a search tool keeps the prompt small for local models on CPU, where every prompt token is
paid again at each step. Which option works better is a question for the evaluation.
